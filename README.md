### Machine Learning Model for Emotion Classification

I developed a Logistic Regression Classifier with an LBFGS Optimization Algorithm and OvA Multiclass Strategy

### Implement on pictures

1. **Load your images to:** logistic_regression/images/unknown/original

2. **Run**: implement_picture.py
* Ensure that your desired model is loaded (e.g. logistic_regression/trained_models/7class_3ksample_42%.pk1)

3. **View classified images in:** logistic_regression/images/unknown/classified

### Implement on live video

1. **Run**: implement_video.py
* Ensure that your desired model is loaded (e.g. logistic_regression/trained_models/7class_3ksample_42%.pk1)
